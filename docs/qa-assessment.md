# QA Assessment — Booking Flow (AI-Checkable,

# Real-World)

This assessment requires you to build and test a realistic booking flow with branching logic, rich
data, realistic UI states, and meaningful test coverage. Submissions are graded strictly based on
demonstrable evidence.

## 1) Submission Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

- Public demo link (no login, VPN, or expiry).
- Alternatively, Docker with single run command (e.g., docker compose up).
- Full source code (Git repo preferred).
- Required files: README.md, manual-tests.md, bug-reports.md, automation/, ui/.

## 2) Richness Gates (Mandatory)

- Multi-path flow: General waste, Heavy waste, Plasterboard (with 3 handling options).
- At least 12 addresses for one postcode and 0 addresses for another.
- At least 8 skip options with mixed enabled/disabled states.
- Loading, empty, and error states with retry functionality.
- Price breakdown in review step.

## 3) Functional Requirements

- Step 1: UK postcode validation, lookup call, address selection or manual entry.
- Step 2: Waste type selection with plasterboard branching logic.
- Step 3: Skip selection with normalization and disabled logic.
- Step 4: Review summary, price breakdown, confirm booking, prevent double submit.

## 4) Deterministic Fixtures (Mandatory)

- SW1A 1AA → 12+ addresses.
- EC1A 1BB → 0 addresses (empty state).
- M1 1AE → Simulated latency.
- BS1 4DJ → 500 error on first call, success on retry.
- Heavy waste disables at least 2 skip sizes.

## 5) API Contract (Must Match)

POST /api/postcode/lookup

```
Request:
{ "postcode": "SW1A 1AA" }
```

```
Response:
{
"postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
"addresses": [
{ "id": "addr_1", "line1": "10 Downing Street", "city": "London" }
]
}
```

POST /api/waste-types

```
Request:
{ "heavyWaste": true, "plasterboard": false, "plasterboardOption": null }
Response:
{ "ok": true }
```

GET /api/skips?postcode=SW1A1AA&heavyWaste;=true

```
Response:
{
"skips": [
{ "size": "4-yard", "price": 120, "disabled": false },
{ "size": "12-yard", "price": 260, "disabled": true }
]
}
```

POST /api/booking/confirm

```
Request:
{
"postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
"addressId": "addr_1",
"heavyWaste": true,
"plasterboard": false,
"skipSize": "4-yard",
"price": 120
}
Response:
{ "status": "success", "bookingId": "BK-12345" }
```

## 6) Manual Test Requirements

- Minimum 35 test cases.
- At least 10 negative tests.
- At least 6 edge cases.
- At least 4 API failure tests.
- At least 4 state transition tests.
- Use strict markdown table format.

## 7) Bug Report Requirements

- Minimum 3 bugs.
- Include severity, priority, environment, steps, actual vs expected, evidence.
- At least 1 bug must involve branching or state transition.

## 8) Automation Requirements

- Automate two E2E flows (general + heavy or plasterboard path).
- Assertions at each step.
- Stable selectors required.
- Explain mocking/test data strategy in README.

## 9) UI/UX Evidence Requirements

- Mobile and desktop screenshots.
- Error and retry states.
- Disabled skip visibility.
- Price breakdown.
- Flow video (60–120 seconds).
- Lighthouse and accessibility report.

## 10) Scoring Overview

- Functional correctness.
- Product realism.
- Manual testing depth.
- Bug reporting quality.
- Automation reliability.
- UI/UX responsiveness and accessibility.
